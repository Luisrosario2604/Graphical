# My Rpg

It's the biggest graphics project I've done at school

This is a remake of a game called "60 seconds"

###### This project was supposed to be done by 4 people but unfortunately all my teammates dropped out of school at that time, so there is only my part (the survival part of the game), enjoy !

The goal is to survive as long as possible, a monster can appear every night, when he dies, you gain an improvement point.

You must try not to reduce a character's hunger, thirst, or health to 0.

You will find the equipment in the chest, and the upgrades just above.

The equipment was supposed to be collected in the first part of the game.
